Hi there!

Astro is an innovative web framework designed to build fast, content-driven websites. It focuses on delivering only the essentials to the browser by default, ensuring lightning-fast performance. Unlike traditional frameworks that bundle everything into a single JavaScript file, Astro embraces a "zero-JS by default" philosophy, shipping minimal JavaScript to the client.

### Key Features
- **Component-based Architecture**: Build with frameworks you love, like React, Vue, or Svelte, seamlessly integrated.
- **Partial Hydration**: Load JavaScript only for interactive parts of your site, keeping the rest static.
- **Server-first Approach**: Write components that run entirely on the server, resulting in reduced client-side load.
- **Integrated Markdown & MDX**: Perfect for blogs or content-heavy sites with native support for Markdown and MDX.

Here's a quick example to get started:

```jsx
import Layout from '../components/Layout.astro';

export default function BlogPost() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>Welcome to Astro!</h1>
      <p>Build faster, lighter, and more optimized websites today.</p>
    </Layout>
  );
}
